        <p>  It was the best of times, </p>
        <p>  it was the worst of times,</p>
        <p>  it was the age of wisdom,</p>
        <p>  it was the age of foolishness,</p>
        <p>  it was the epoch of belief,</p>
        <p>  it was the epoch of incredulity,</p>
        <p>  it was the season of Light,</p>
        <p>  it was the season of Darkness,</p>
        <p>  it was the spring of hope, </p>
        <p>  it was the winter of despair, </p>

      <p><b>There were a king with a large jaw an and; there were a king with a large jaw and a queen with a fair face, on the throne of France. In both countries it was clearer  than crystal to the lords of the State preserves of loaves and fishes, that things in general were settled for ever.  </b></p>
