    <h2>Prologue</h2>


    <div>

    <p>   I found the box in the attic of an old farmhouse in Norway. It was large, the size of
      a footlocker, and there were markings on it; runes, I learned later. </p>
    <p>   When I opened the lid, it looked like the box contained mostly papers, a jum-
      bled mass of them, in several different languages and written in different styles of
      handwriting. There were diaries, maps, even ships' logs. </p>
    <p>   As I dug deeper, under the papers, I found more: skeins of wool; small boots
      made of soft leather; sheaves of music tied with faded ribbon; long, thin pieces of
      wood with maplike markings on them; dried-up mushrooms; woven belts; even a
      dress the color of the moon. </p>
    <p>   Then I came upon what looked to be the mouthpiece of a very old reed instru-
      ment. I held it up toward the light coming through the small attic window. As the
      late afternoon sun caught it, a most extraordinary thing happened. I heard the clear,
      high note of a flute. </p>
    <p> <i>   And it was coming from inside the trunk. </i> </p>
    <p>   Other sounds came then—whispering, muttering, swirling around inside my
      head. Dogs barking, sleigh bells, the cracking of ice. Voices. <i> Hearing voices—this
      isn't good, </i> I thought. </p>
      <p> Still holding the ancient mouthpiece in the palm of my hand, I lifted the top
      piece of paper out of the trunk. It was a handwritten note. </p>

    <p>  <i>They want me to write it all down, though I'm not sure why. </p>
    <p> <i>  It seems enough that Father and Neddy wrote down their parts. Especially Neddy;
      he was always the storyteller in the family. I am not a storyteller, not really. It takes
      more patience than I've got—or rather, than I used to have. I guess I did learn a little
      bit about patience in the course of the journey. But even so, I'd much rather set the story
      down in cloth. Well, actually I have. Hangs on the north wall in the great room, and
      the whole story is there. </i> </p>
    <p> <i>  But words are easier to understand for most people. </i> </p>
    <p> <i>  So I will try. </i> </p>
    <p> <i>   It isn't easy for me to walk the path back to the beginning of the story, even to know
      where the true beginning is. And telling a story, I suppose, is like winding a skein of spun
      yarn—you sometimes lose track of the beginning. </i> </p>
    <p> <i>   All I intended to do, when I began the journey, was to set things right. They say los-
      ing someone you love is like losing a part of your own body. An eye or a leg. But it is far
      worse—especially when it is your fault. </i> </p>
    <p> <i> But already I'm getting ahead of myself. <a href="../index.html">It all began with a pair of soft boots.</a>
