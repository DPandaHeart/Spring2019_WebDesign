    <h2>Troll Queen</h2>


    <div>

    <p> IT BEGAN DURING MY FIRST journey to the green lands. The joy that seemed to steal
my breath forever. And the knowing-I-must-have or I would perish.
He was a boy then. Playing a game with other children. A round red ball they
threw back and forth. Laughing. He and the other children left, then he came back
to find the ball, alone. Sweet, fortuitous miracle. I could have willed it so, with my
arts, but was too dazzled, unthinking. </p>
His eyesight must have been better than most softskins', for he saw me. Or
perhaps that was because of my arts, used even without my knowing. I wanted him
to see me.
<p> He ran up to me. His face was so strange, with its curling-up mouth showing
white teeth, and his bright green-blue eyes. He held out the ball and said, <a href="../p5/index.html">"Would
you like to play?"</a>
 </p>
<p> That is when it began, the strange breath-losing feeling. The wanting.
And so I took him. Not then, that day. But later.
My father's rage was immense. He said I had broken all the laws of our people,
the most ancient, the most binding of laws. </p>
<p> I tried to explain to him the way I had done it, so that none of his people knew I
had taken him. It was very clever, ingenious. But it was not enough, and my father
set up an enchantment. Binding. And with conditions. </p>
<p> I hated it but could not change it. My father was still more powerful than me
then. It could not be undone. Even now it cannot. </p>
<p> The conditions were intended as punishment, for breaking the ancient laws, but
my father also wove in the opportunity for me to have that which I desired. And
once the conditions were met, then the softskin boy would be mine. Forever. </p>
