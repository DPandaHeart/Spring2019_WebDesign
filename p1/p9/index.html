      <p> THE FIRST THING I MADE on Widow Hautzig's loom was a table runner. It had a
      simple reindeer design in the weave, and I was absurdly proud of it. My next
      projects were a shawl for Mother and head scarves for my three sisters. Then I
      made a jacket for Neddy and a pair of breeches for Father.  </p>
      <p> The last thing I made on that loom was for me. A cloak. It took me nearly half a
      year to finish. It was during this time that things went so wrong with the farm. </p>
     Father told me the bad luck began the year I was born. The barley crop failed,
      and that setback was followed by an unusually harsh winter that killed off our
      largest sow. Since then there had been blight that killed our fruit trees, a sickness
      that went through our poultry, not to mention a heartbreaking series of crop fail-
      ures. By the summer when I was working on my cloak, there was so little to go
      around that it didn't seem right to be hunting chanterelles for Widow Hautzig; nor
      was there much time for weaving, other than that which was strictly necessary. We
      were all working so hard just to keep from starving. And there was no extra wool
      for spinning.
      <p> For a long time I had been in the habit of scrounging for tufts of wool. I would
      find them stuck to fences and the bark of trees. But it really wasn't enough, and it
      was only thanks to Father that I was able to finish my cloak at all. He brought me
      wool, clumps that he had bargained for from neighbors, and he insisted that I take
      breaks from chores to go chanterelle hunting with Snurri. </p>
    <p>   Widow Hautzig's tongue grew sharper over the years. She was unsympathetic
      to our ill fortune, sometimes even openly cruel about it, making nasty remarks
      about my father's farming abilities. I would have stopped going altogether had I
      not been on the verge of finishing my cloak. It was the best piece I had ever made.
      As our life got worse and worse <a href="../p10/index.html">at the farm.</a>, I even thought I might sell it, to bring in badly needed money, but Father wouldn't hear of it. He said the cloak belonged
to me. The next thing I made, he suggested, we would sell. </p>
