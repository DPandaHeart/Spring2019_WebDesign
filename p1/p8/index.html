    <p> WHEN ROSE WAS FIVE, she began to <a href="../p9/index.html">weave.</a>. The first thing she made was a belt with
    a crude design of a white bear. Those were her two passions: weaving (or sewing)
    and exploring with her imaginary white bear. </p>
    <p> Inside the house she could always be found weaving belts on her small, rigid
    heddle loom. When we had more belts than we could ever use (some of the farm
    animals even sported Rose's belts), Mother taught Rose to work the household
    loom. By age eight Rose was her older sisters' equal when it came to weaving. </p>
    <p> Then one day, taking a basketful of eggs to Widow Hautzig, Rose laid eyes on
    the widow's loom. Widow Hautzig was a local craftswoman who had a small busi-
    ness weaving coats and rugs and various other items to sell both in nearby Andal-
    snes and to wandering merchants who would take them to fairs and markets far-
    ther afield. To Rose, who knew only our own rough one at home, the widow's loom
    was large and impressive. It was twice as tall as Rose, and the wood was polished
    and carved with simple designs.  </p>
    <p> Unfortunately, Widow Hautzig was a grouchy old woman with no patience at all
    for a small, wild girl desperate to learn all about her beautiful loom. More than any-
    thing in the world, Rose longed for a loom of her own, a fine big one like the wid-
    ow's. But she knew that was impossible, that Father would never be able to afford
    it. Still, Rose was stubborn, and she would not rest until she had found a way to
    get the Widow Hautzig to let her use her loom. </p>
  <p>  When she was nine Rose found out that Widow Hautzig had a weakness for
    chanterelle mushrooms. So Rose trained her favorite dog, Snurri, to sniff out
    chanterelles in the forest. After much hard work she struck a deal: In exchange for a
    weekly basket of chanterelle mushrooms, Widow Hautzig would teach Rose how to
    work her loom. Though the lessons were short and very disagreeable (often Rose would come home in tears over some gibe of the widow's), still Rose was a deter-
    mined pupil, and before long the baskets of chanterelles were being traded for a
    chance to actually do her own weaving on the loom. </p>
