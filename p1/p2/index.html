    <p>I COULD SAY THAT I FELT guilty and ashamed about the trouble I was always getting
into when I was a child, driving my mother to her wit's end on a daily basis. But the
truth is I never did feel either of those things. </p>
I don't think it's because I was selfish or unfeeling. I just couldn't understand
what all the fuss was about. What was a little spilled blood or a broken bone now
and then?
<p>I never set out to be disobedient. I just couldn't keep my thoughts, and then my
feet, still. I'd see something—the azure flash of a butterfly's wing, a formation of
clouds like a ship's mast and sails, a ripe yellow apple perched high in a tree—and
I'd be off after it without a second thought. </p>
<p>Exploring ran in my blood. My grandfather Esbjorn was a mapmaker as well as
an explorer. And my great-great-grandfather was one of the first Njordens to travel
to Constantinople. </p>
<p>The only thing that gave me the slightest twinge of sadness was Neddy, with his
exasperated, sorry-for-himself look when he found me after yet another time I'd run
off without telling anyone. </p>
<p>"But I saw this rabbit with a tail so white it glowed" I'd try to explain (when I was
old enough to put words to my feelings). </p>
<p><a href="../p3/index.html">Neddy</a> would just sigh and say that Mother wanted me in the kitchen straight-
away. </p>
<p>"I'm sorry, Neddy," I'd say, wrapping my arms around his legs, watching the
corners of his mouth for the smile I always managed to squeeze out of him. And
then I'd go to the kitchen and Mother would scold me yet again. </p>
