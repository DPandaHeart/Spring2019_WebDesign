    <p>FATHER TOLD ME THAT my first gift was a pair of boots, made of the soft leather of
    reindeer hide. Which was very fitting, for I loved wearing boots.
    I always wore my older brothers' and sisters' hand-me-downs, though that
    never bothered me. The boots had already been resoled many times by the time I
    got them, but I must have put more miles on those boots than all of my brothers
    and sisters together.  </p>
    <p>By the time I was five or six, I had already gone missing more times than my
    parents could count. One of my favorite games was to imagine myself a bold ex-
    plorer, like my grandfather and great-grandfather. I had made it my goal to discover
    and claim every square inch of the land that lay within walking distance of our farm.
    On the day I first saw a white bear, I had slipped out of the house when my sis-
    ter Selme was distracted by a frog I had hidden in a pan in the kitchen cupboard. I
    climbed the stone wall that lay to the northeast of our farm and ran through the
    meadow, but instead of climbing the rocky crag (which I'm told I had fallen off of
    and then nearly drowned when I was two years old), I headed due north. I walked a
    very long way, finally coming upon a small grove of trees. There, standing among
    them, was a white bear. It stood very still, watching me. </p>
  <p>  I stopped, staring with delight at the snow-white fur. I wasn't close enough to
    see its eyes clearly and what expression they held, but I was too young to be afraid,
    so I smiled widely at the animal. It gazed at me for a short time, then turned and
    lumbered away. I tried following, but it had vanished. Soon I got hungry and turned
    toward home. </p>
  <p>  I didn't tell Mother and Father about seeing the white bear, especially Mother,
    because I knew she'd insist on keeping me even closer to home. "You see!" she'd
    say. "Dangerous wild animals are out there. It's not safe."</p>
  <p>  I told Neddy, though, and was disappointed at his reaction. He frowned and
    said in that superior, older brother tone I hated, "You mustn't go anywhere near a
    white bear, Rose. They are dangerous and fierce creatures, with long, sharp teeth
    that will gobble you up. They are always hungry and they move very fast." He acted
    like he was some kind of expert on white bears. </p>
    <p>I didn't pay any attention to him. From then on the white bear was my imag-
    inary companion on all my explorations. I would pretend that I was riding along on
    its white-fur back, the two of us a fierce duo conquering and claiming new lands by
    the score. </p>
    <p>I spent much of my childhood longing, in vain, to see a white bear again. It was
    extremely rare to see white bears in our part of the country. They were ice bears,
    <a href="../p7/index.html"><i>isbjorn<i></a>, that usually made their home in the snowy north. </p>
