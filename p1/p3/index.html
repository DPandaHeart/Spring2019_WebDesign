    <p>  OUR FAMILY WASN'T ALWAYS poor. My grandfather Esbjorn Lavrans had a well-
  respected mapmaking business, and my father's father was a prosperous farmer.
  But Father had a falling-out with his family when he went to Bergen to be an ap-
  prentice to the mapmaker Esbjorn. My mother, Eugenia, was Esbjorn's daughter,
  which is how Father met her. </p>
  <p>Father and Mother had eight children. Rose was the last-born and I was second
  to last, four years old when they brought Rose home from Askoy Forest. Some
  would say four is too young to remember, but I definitely have memories. Lots of
  them. I remember her smell, like warm milk and soft green moss. I remember the
  noises she'd make—gurgling like the creek we later took to calling Rosie's Creek
  because she fell into it so often; the clicking she made with her tongue, like a wren
  pecking at our chimney; the howls of frustration when she kept toppling over while
  learning to walk. Not that it took her long. She was running around on her short
  legs at just five months. </p>
  <p>I also remember clearly the evening Mother and Father came home from an
  afternoon of herb hunting, and instead of herbs they were carrying a lumpy bundle
  that made funny noises. </p>
<p>  My older brothers and sisters had been worried about Mother and Father be-
  cause there had been a storm and they were much later than usual returning. I told
  everyone not to worry, that they had gone out to bring home the baby and that's
  why they were so late getting home. </p>
  <p>My older sister Selme laughed. "Mother is still more than a month away from
  her lying-in time," she said. "And besides, everyone knows you can't just go pluck
  babies out of Askoy Forest," she added with a superior look.
  But it turned out I was right after all. </p>
<p>  When they finally came through the door, Mother looked very pale and sat
  down as soon as she could, holding the noisy thing on her lap. The others crowd-
  ed around, but I hung back, waiting. When they'd all looked long enough, Father
  led me to Mother's side. When I gazed at the little scrunched-up face, I felt a pecu-
  liar glow of pride. Like I'd done something good. I knew it was Mother who'd
  brought this baby into the world (and she certainly looked worn out from doing it),
  but from that moment I felt like the wild little brownhaired baby was my very own
  gift—and that it would be my job to watch over her. </p>
  <p> If I had known just how wild a thing she would turn out to be, I might have
  thought twice about taking her on. It's a funny thing. I think it was Mother and I
  who had the hardest time with Rose's wandering ways. But we both had different
  ways of living with it. Mother tried always to reel her in. To keep her close by. But
  for me, I knew it couldn't be done, <a href="../p4/index.html">so I just ached and felt sorry for myself when
  she'd disappear</a>. That's the trouble with loving a wild thing: You're always left
  watching the door. </p>
<p>  But you also get kind of used to it. </p>
