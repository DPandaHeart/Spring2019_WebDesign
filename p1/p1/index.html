    <h2>Father</h2>

    <p>EBBA <a href="../p2/index.html">ROSE</a>WAS THE NAME of our last-born child. Except it was a lie. Her name
    should have been Nyamh Rose. But everyone called her Rose rather than Ebba, so
    the lie didn't matter. At least, that is what I told myself.
    The Rose part of her name came from the symbol that lies at the center of the
    wind roseâ€”which is fitting because she was lodged at the very center of my heart.
    I loved each of her seven brothers and sisters, but I will admit there was always
    something that set Rose apart from the others. And it wasn't just the way she
    looked. </p>
    <p>  She was the hardest to know of my children, and that was because she would
    not stay still. Every time I held her as a babe, she would look up at me, intent, smil-
    ing with her bright purple eyes. But soon, and always, those eyes would stray past
    my shoulder, seeking the window and what lay beyond.
    Rose's first gift was a small pair of soft boots made of reindeer hide. They were
    brought by Torsk, a neighbor, and as he fastened them on Rose's tiny feet with his
    large calloused hands, I saw my wife, Eugenia, frown. She tried to hide it, turning
    her face away. </p>
    <p>Torsk did not see the frown but looked up at us, beaming. He was a widower
    with grown sons and a gift for leatherwork. Eager to show off his handiwork and
    unmindful of the difficult circumstances of Eugenia's recent birthing, he had been
    the first to show up on our doorstep.
    Most of our neighbors were well aware of how superstitious Eugenia was. They
    also knew that a baby's first gift was laden with meaning. But cheerful, largehanded
    Torsk paid no heed to this. He just gazed down at the small soft boots on Rose's
    feet and looked ready to burst with pride.
    "The fit is good," he observed with a wide smile. </p>
